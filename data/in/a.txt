Sunlight caught the edge of the notebook, scattering tiny gold maps across the table.
A warm breeze carried the smell of coffee and distant rain.
7:42 AM — the clock ticked like a patient metronome, counting small, ordinary miracles.

Random numbers: 17, 204, 3.14159, 42.
A single red leaf floated past the window and vanished into the city hum.
Notes: remember to breathe, to look up, to smile at strangers.
End of a.txt — unsigned, uncomplicated, true.
